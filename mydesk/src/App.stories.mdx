<Story name="App">
  <p>
    In the App file we define all the routes of the project. Here we include
    lazy loading to reduce load times and increase performance without loading
    unused components.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are using React-Router v6 for routing,Ant Design for UI components,Moment
    JS and Date Functions for date manipulation, UUID for unique id's when
    rendering, we use custom login form and React-Microsoft-Login and Google
    Identity Services for Single Sign On, and axios for most of our API
    requests. We are also using antd-table-saveas-excel for exporting the
    reservation list data as an excel file.
