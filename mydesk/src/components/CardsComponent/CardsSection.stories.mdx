# Cards Section

  <Story name="Cards Section">
    <p>
    In the card section, we fetch data based on the office and render as many
    desks as we need. Here it renders based on multiple filters. 
    <ul>
      <li><span style={{color: "green"}}>Green</span>: Available</li>
      <li><span style={{color: "red"}}>Red</span>: Reserved</li>
      <li><span style={{color: "gray"}}>Gray</span>: Unavailable</li>
    </ul>
    It displays the number of the desk and a small icon that when you hover over it, it shows the information what properties the desk has containing the following
    <ul>
      <li>Near Window</li>
      <li>Single Monitor</li>    
      <li>Dual Monitor</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    The filters work after you select a start and end date. If the selected dates overlap the cards will change to a red color and will show the start and end date of the reservation and the person who it's reserved for.
    <br />
    When the user changes an office while the data is being fetched, it will abort the process saving precious resources.
