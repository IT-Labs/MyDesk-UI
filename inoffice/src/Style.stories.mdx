# Css Compilers

<Story name="Css Compilers">
  <p>
    The application uses 2 types of css compilers. The bulk of the user created
    components use Sass/Scss for its readablity and way of handling variables
    and styles. The second compiler used is Less, thats because Antd uses Less
    for its component library and it cannot be changed.
