    <p>
      In the login form we use the react-microsoft-login library. This library
      is used to simplify the entire process for SSO and makes the application
      more secure. We define our client id and tenant id from the Azure portal,
      what graph permissions that we want, in this case user.readbasic.all and
      user.read, a redirect url so it knows where to go when you enter all
      microsoft information needed, and a callback function to get all other
      information including the access token which we use for the graph api.
