# Header

<Canvas name="Header">
  <Story name="Header">
    <p>
      The header component uses multiple components
      <ul>
        <li>The logo: <img src={logo} alt="logo" style={{width: 60, height: 60}} /></li>
        <li>The log out button: <LogoutOutlined style={{position: "relative", top: "-10px"}}/></li>
        <li>And the user information: <span>John Doe</span><img src={avatar} alt='avatar' style={{width: 45, height: 45, borderRadius: "50%"}}/> </li>
      </ul>
      When clicking on the logo, it takes you to the homepage where you can make a reservation in any office of your choice.<br/>
      By clicking the logout button you remove your current access to the page and will have to log in again to access the application's features<br />
      The user information tab is used to travel to the dashboard of sorts. This is covered in greater detail in the Sidebar story.
